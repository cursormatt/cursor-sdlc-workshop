# Team Members

Add a file named after your GitHub username to this folder (e.g., `asmith.md`).

> **Ask Cursor:** "Add me to this team. My name is [name] and my GitHub username is [username]."

You can also copy your member file from the `teams/` section if you already made one there.

## Template

```markdown
# [Your Name]

**GitHub:** [@your-username](https://github.com/your-username)
```
